- **Source Code**: is any collection of code, with or without comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.
- **SSL**: SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It’s a standard security protocol for ensuring that all data transmitted between the web server and the browser remains encrypted—and therefore unreadable to the naked eye. You can tell if a website has an SSL certificate by looking at the web address: if the URL starts with “https”, the website is secure. You’ll also see a padlock symbol in the browser bar.
- **stack**: In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type (ADT) that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. Stack is commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example – a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc. A real-world stack allows operations at one end only. For example, we can place or remove a card or plate from the top of the stack only. Likewise, Stack ADT allows all data operations at one end only. At any given time, we can only access the top element of a stack. This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first.
- **statement**: a single line of code that is used to perform a specific task.
- **stress testing**: Stress Testing is a type of software testing that verifies stability & reliability of software application. Stress testing is a software testing activity that determines the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation. Stress testing is particularly important for "mission critical" software, but is used for all types of software. The goal of Stress testing is measuring software on its robustness and error handling capabilities under extremely heavy load conditions and ensuring that software doesn't crash under crunch situations.
- **string**: a sequence of characters.
- **string concatenation**: is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end.
- **subexpression**: a part of an expression that is by itself a correct expression.
- **subnet mask**: a 32-bit number that separates an IP address into the network and host addresses.
- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: a vector graphics file format that enables two-dimensional images to be displayed in XML pages on the Web.
- **syntax**: the grammar of a programming language.
- **system testing**: System testing is testing conducted on a complete integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements. System testing takes, as its input, all of the integrated components that have passed integration testing. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one element of a larger computer-based system.
- **SRE**: Site Reliability Engineering is a growing discipline that fills in gaps between Dev & Ops.

## T

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: a communication protocol used most often on networks that use Internet Protocol (IP)
- **template**: a preformatted file that serve as the starting point for another file.
- **tenary operator**: an operator that takes three arguments.
- **testing**: a process to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements or not and to identify the bugs to ensure that the product is bug-free.
- **testing framework**: a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases.
- **text editor**: A text editor is just a type of software used to write plain, unformatted text. You’ll use a text editor such as SublimeText, TextEdit or TextWrangler to write your initial code. Then, later on, it will be formatted to make it computer-readable.
- **thread**: a way for a program to divide itself into two or more simultaneously running tasks.
- **thread pool**: a defined number of pre-initialized threads which stand by, ready to be given work
- **token**: a single element of a programming language. _Eg keyword, operator_
- **tree**: a data structure in which each element is attached to one or more elements directly beneath it.
- **type (data type)**: an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

## U

- **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is one of the last stages of the software development life cycle. It is performed after the software has been thoroughly tested. It is sometimes known as End User Testing. UAT is a type of testing performed by the end user or the client to verify/accept the software system before moving the software application to the production environment. UAT is done in the final phase of testing after functional, integration and system testing is done.
- **UI (User Interface)**: the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device.
- **unit testing**: In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.
- **unix**: Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
- **UX (User Experience)**: is what a user of a particular product experiences when using that product.
- **unary operator**: an operator that takes a single operand and performs an operation.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme.
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: the address of a given unique resource on the Web.

## V

- **variable**: is used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. Its purpose is to label and store data in memory so that the user may use it throughout the program if needed.
- **Version Control System (VCS)**: a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- **Visual Basic (VB)**: The original Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language from Microsoft known for its Component Object Model programming model first released in 1991 and declared legacy during 2008. Microsoft intended Visual Basic to be relatively easy to learn and use.
- **VM (Virtual Machine)**: A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). Software called a hypervisor separates the machine’s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.

## W

- **web browser**: A web browser, or simply 'browser', is an application used to access and view websites. Common web browsers include Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.
- **web components**: a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
- **webhooks**: automated messages sent from apps when something happens.
- **WebRTC**: A browser-based programming interface (API) from the W3C for voice and video calling that bypasses the traditional telephone networks.
- **web server**: A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP, the network protocol created to distribute web pages, or its secure variant HTTPS.
- **web service**: A web service is a piece of software that makes itself available over the internet.Web services are self-contained, modular, distributed, dynamic applications that can be described, published, located, or invoked over the network. These applications can be local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are built on top of open standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java, HTML, and XML.

## X

- **XHTML**: Extensible HyperText Markup Language is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language, the language in which Web pages are formulated.
- **XML**: a markup language with rules to be readable by machines and humans.

## Y

- **YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**: a markup language similar to XML using minimal syntax, natively using lists, scalars and associative arrays. YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML.
- **yarn**: Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.
